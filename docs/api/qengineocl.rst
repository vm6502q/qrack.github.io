QEngineOCL
========================

Defined in `qengine_opencl.hpp <https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack/blob/master/include/qengine_opencl.hpp>`_.

The API is provided by Qrack::QInterface, via Qrack::Engine. However, QEngineOCL has a custom constructor:

.. doxygenfunction:: Qrack::QEngineOCL::QEngineOCL(bitLenInt, const bitCapInt&, qrack_rand_gen_ptr, const complex&, bool, bool, bool, int64_t, bool, bool, real1_f, std::vector<int>, bitLenInt)
