QBdt
========================

Defined in `QBdt.hpp <https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack/blob/main/include/qbinary_decision_tree.hpp>`_ and `qbinary_decision_node.hpp <https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack/blob/main/include/QBdt.hpp>`_.

The API is provided by Qrack::QInterface. Qrack::QBdt is an attempt at an alternative representation of quantum pure states, in terms of quantum binary decision trees, inspired by `other open source work <https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_dd/>`_.
