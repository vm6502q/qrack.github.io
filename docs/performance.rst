See our comparative benchmarks preprint: `"Exact and approximate simulation of large quantum circuits on a single GPU" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14969>`_

The preprint offers a comprehensive comparison of exact simulation times across GPU-based quantum computer simulators, as well as a discussion of approximate simulation techniques in Qrack and fidelity results on a 54-qubit simulated circuit.

Numerical and graphical assets from the report are available in the `Unitary Fund research repository on GitHub. <https://github.com/unitaryfund/research/tree/main/qrack-report>`_
